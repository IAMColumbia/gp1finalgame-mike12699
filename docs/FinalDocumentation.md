Description Long:  The player will start off right away and shoot the aliens on the screen. The instructions, lives and timer will be diaplayed on screen while the player is playing the game. When all enemies are defeated, the game will switch to the win screen win called. The win screen will congratulate the player, show their current time, and prompt them to press "Enter" to restart the game. When the player loses, that is when an alien reaches the bottom, the game will switch to the lose screen and also prompt the player to press "Enter" to restart the game. The player can replay as many times as they want to aim for a faster time when they win the game.

Credits: Credits go to the game "Space Invaders" and Taito the company who made this game, as this final project is heavily influenced by "Space Invaders" because of the gameplay and the alien sprites. Additional credits go to Microsoft for some C# terms I had to look up in order to create my project the way I wanted it to play out. 

Genre:	Arcade/Shooter
